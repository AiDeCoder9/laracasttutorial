for notifications


to create a notification

php artisan make:notification SubscriptionRenewalFailed


to get the methods that can be used into Notification or any kind of mail view these file

SimpleMessage.php

MailMessage.php


to database specific notification we have to create a notification table

php artisan notification:table


notification table has a polymorphic relationship means the data can be accessed by each model it is created by

for example if you are a admin and you send a SubscriptionRenewal verification then the notifiable_type = App\Admin
Similary

if you are a librarian and you send a SubscriptionRenewal verification then the notifiable_type = App\Librarian


and you can access the data like

$admin->notifications;
or
$admin->unreadNotications
or
$admin->notify()


where $admin is instance of Admin Model



known command
$admin->markedAsRead()
$admin->unreadNotifications()
to specific id

$admin->notifications->where('id',1)->markAsRead();


to bundle the assets of webpack.config.json and to use extract() and version method



//collection methods
to view the available methods go to collections.php


some of the example

$user =App\User::all()

$user = App\User;

$user->find(4)
$user->first();
$user->last()

$user ->where('email','sajan@gmail.com');
$user ->where('email','sajan@gmail.com')->first()->name();
$user->pluck('email');//gets all the user
$user->pluck('email')->toArray();//covert to array

$user->map(function($user){
return $user->name});



$user->filter(function ($user){return   $user->id >=3;});


to make a collection of own

collect(['data1','data3','data2']);
